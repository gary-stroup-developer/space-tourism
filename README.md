# Frontend Mentor Space Tourism Multipage site

## Technology used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

#Goal
The goal of this project is to build a fully functional space tourism website using plain HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. I tried to stick to the design layout given but modified the font family. This is my first iteration of the challenge. I look to build this project using React for the second iteration and focus on improving the css parameters and naming conventions.
